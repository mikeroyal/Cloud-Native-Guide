[Back to the Top](https://github.com/mikeroyal/Cloud-Native-Guide/blob/master/README.md#table-of-contents)

## DevOps

**Application Framework**

[Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) is an open-source micro framework maintained by Pivotal, which was acquired by VMware in 2019. It provides Java developers with a platform to get started with an auto configurable production-grade Spring application.

[Apache Mesos](http://mesos.apache.org/) is a cluster manager that provides efficient resource isolation and sharing across distributed applications, or frameworks. It can run Hadoop, Jenkins, Spark, Aurora, and other frameworks on a dynamically shared pool of nodes.

[Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) is a unified analytics engine for big data processing, with built-in modules for streaming, SQL, machine learning and graph processing.

[Apache Hadoop](http://hadoop.apache.org/) is a framework that allows for the distributed processing of large data sets across clusters of computers using simple programming models. It is designed to scale up from single servers to thousands of machines, each offering local computation and storage. Rather than rely on hardware to deliver high-availability, the library itself is designed to detect and handle failures at the application layer, so delivering a highly-available service on top of a cluster of computers, each of which may be prone to failures.

**Runtime Platform**

[BOSH](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/bosh/) is a tool that prepares your infrastructure for what needs to be managed. BOSH espouses software engineering best practices, such as continuous delivery, by making it easy to create software releases that automatically update complex distributed systems with simple commands.Due to the flexibility and power of BOSH, Google and VMware made it the heart of the Kubo project, now called the Cloud Foundry Container Runtime, based on Kubernetes.

**Infrastructure Automatation**

[Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) is a build automation tool used primarily for Java projects. Maven can also be used to build and manage projects written in C#, Ruby, Scala, and other languages. The Maven project is hosted by the Apache Software Foundation.

[Gradle](https://gradle.org/) is an open-source build-automation system that builds upon the concepts of Apache Ant and Apache Maven and introduces a Groovy-based domain-specific language instead of the XML form used by Apache Maven for declaring the project configuration.

[Azure Draft](https://draft.sh/) is a tool for developers to create cloud-native applications on Kubernetes. 

[Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/) integrates industry-leading tools(data management, hybrid & multi-cloud, and AI & ML) with Cloud Storage for enhanced support with everything from security and data transfer, to data backup and archive. Expand all . Backup, archival, and disaster recovery. Along with File systems and gateways.

[OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/) is a free and open-source software platform for cloud computing, mostly deployed as infrastructure-as-a-service that controls large pools of compute, storage, and networking resources throughout a datacenter, managed through a dashboard or via the OpenStack API. OpenStack works with popular enterprise and open source technologies making it ideal for heterogeneous infrastructure.

[Cloud Foundry](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/) is an open source, multi cloud application platform as a service that makes it faster and easier to build, test, deploy and scale applications, providing a choice of clouds, developer frameworks, and application services. It is an open source project and is available through a variety of private cloud distributions and public cloud instances.

Prow has a microservice architecture implemented as a collection of container images that run as Kubernetes deployments.

## Microservices

[AWS ECS](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/) is a highly scalable, high-performance container orchestration service that supports Docker containers and allows you to easily run and scale containerized applications on AWS. Amazon ECS eliminates the need for you to install and operate your own container orchestration software, manage and scale a cluster of virtual machines, or schedule containers on those virtual machines.

It receives requests on behalf of your system and finds out which components are responsible for handling them. What sets Traefik apart, besides its many features, is that it automatically discovers the right configuration for your services.

## Containers

[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) is an open-source container-orchestration system for automating application deployment, scaling, and management. It was originally designed by Google, and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation.

[Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/) is a managed, production-ready environment for deploying containerized applications.

[OpenShift](https://www.openshift.com/) is focused on security at every level of the container stack and throughout the application lifecycle. It includes long-term, enterprise support from one of the leading Kubernetes contributors and open source software companies.

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is a set of platform as a service products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. Containers are isolated from one another and bundle their own software, libraries and configuration files; they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels. All containers are run by a single operating-system kernel and are thus more lightweight than virtual machines.

[Dockle](https://containers.goodwith.tech/) is a Container Image Linter for Security, Helping build the Best-Practice Docker Image.

[TwistLock](https://www.esecurityplanet.com/products/twistlock/) is a Cloud Native Cybersecurity Platform that provides full lifecycle security for containerized environments.

The Twistlock Platform goes beyond just containers to secure the entire cloud native stack, from the host OS to serverless functions.

[Rook](https://rook.io/) is an open source cloud-native storage orchestrator for Kubernetes that turns distributed storage systems into self-managing, self-scaling, self-healing storage services. It automates the tasks of a storage administrator: deployment, bootstrapping, configuration, provisioning, scaling, upgrading, migration, disaster recovery, monitoring, and resource management.

[Rkt](https://coreos.com/rkt/) is a pod-native container engine for Linux. It is composable, secure, and built on standards. 

[Open Container Initiative](https://opencontainers.org/about/overview/) is an open governance structure for the express purpose of creating open industry standards around container formats and runtimes.

[Buildah](https://buildah.io/) is a command line tool to build Open Container Initiative (OCI) images. It can be used with Docker, Podman, Kubernetes.

[Podman](https://podman.io/) is a daemonless, open source, Linux native tool designed to make it easy to find, run, build, share and deploy applications using Open Containers Initiative (OCI) Containers and Container Images. Podman provides a command line interface (CLI) familiar to anyone who has used the Docker Container Engine.

[Containerd](https://containerd.io) is a daemon that manages the complete container lifecycle of its host system, from image transfer and storage to container execution and supervision to low-level storage to network attachments and beyond. It is available for Linux and Windows.
